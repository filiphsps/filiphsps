# I'm Filiph!

Howdy y'all! I'm Filiph SandstrÃ¶m, a software engineer and open source developer born 2000 in Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª!

> [!TIP]
> If you like any of my open source projects cursed or not and also want to enable me to spend even more time on them, you can support me through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/filiphsps). It's more appreciated than you know and **incredibly helpful**!

My open source presence mainly consists of working on whatever I find interesting at that specific moment in time and have happened to grab my attention, so you can never really tell what kind of projects the future holds for me. But if you'd like to try you can checkout my [recent](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+is%3Apublic+author%3Afiliphsps&type=pullrequests&s=created&o=desc) pull requests weird as they may or may not be.

### How We Got Here

Since starting out with software development as a very young kid[^2], I have pretty much managed to work on everything and anything from homebrew apps and games[^3], to a _(really bad)_[^4] HTML renderer [NXTBrowser](https://github.com/filiphsps/NXTBrowser), to the Minecraft Bedrock Edition server software [JSPrismarine](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine) written entirely in TypeScript, to react components like [react-tender](https://github.com/NordcomInc/react-tender) and utilities like [react-shopify-analytics](https://github.com/NordcomInc/react-shopify-analytics), to just useful and simple [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/~filiphsandstrom), to a operating system [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/commits/master/?author=filiphsps), to a Windows Shell replacement with live-tiles [AdaptiveShell](https://github.com/filiphsps/AdaptiveShell).

[^2]: I started coding at 7 or 8 years old though I didn't really do anything till around the age of 10/11-ish if you don't count smaller text-based games and general scripting.
[^3]: e.g. [WiiCraft](https://github.com/filiphsps/WiiCraft) and [DownloadMii](https://github.com/filiphsps/DownloadMii-3DS), projects I used to work on in my free time as a young-ish teenager.
