Welcome to my GitHub page. I've spent quite a lot of time contributing to open source and managing projects.
So I'm sure you'll find something interesting here!

If you're looking to get in contact with me you do so through [my email](mailto:filiph.sandstrom@filfatstudios.com).

Or if you'd rather support my bussiness buy some candy over at [Candy By Sweden](https://candybysweden.com) ðŸš€
