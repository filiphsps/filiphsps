# I'm Filiph

Howdy y'all! I'm Filiph SandstrÃ¶m[^1], a product engineer and (open source) software developer born 2000 in Sweden ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª. Currently on a mission to elevate and improve e-commerce through [@NordcomInc](https://github.com/NordcomInc) while also creating great open source software and tooling, come join us!

My open source presence mainly consists of working on whatever I find interesting at that specific moment and have happened to grab my attention, so you can never really know what kind of projects the future holds for me.

[^1]: Sometimes (often previously) known under the alias `filfat`, mostly from way back in the day and mainly on homebrew forums like [gbatemp](https://gbatemp.net/members/filfat.318416/).

<!---
### How We Got Here

Since starting out with software development as a very young kid[^2], I have pretty much managed to work on everything and anything from homebrew apps and games[^3], to a _(really bad)_[^4] HTML renderer [NXTBrowser](https://github.com/filiphsps/NXTBrowser), to the Minecraft Bedrock Edition server software [JSPrismarine](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine) written entirely in TypeScript, to react components like [react-tender](https://github.com/NordcomInc/react-tender) and utilities like [react-shopify-analytics](https://github.com/NordcomInc/react-shopify-analytics), to just useful and simple [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/~filiphsandstrom), to a operating system [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/commits/master/?author=filiphsps), to a Windows Shell replacement with live-tiles [AdaptiveShell](https://github.com/filiphsps/AdaptiveShell).

[^2]: I started coding at 7 or 8 years old though I didn't really do anything before around the age of 10/11.
[^3]: e.g. [WiiCraft](https://github.com/filiphsps/WiiCraft) and [DownloadMii](https://github.com/filiphsps/DownloadMii-3DS), projects I used to work on in my free time as a young-ish teenager.

Either way it's very much appreciated and **incredibly helpful** as it allows me to spend even more time on open source
